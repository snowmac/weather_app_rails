# Coding Assignment

Requirements:

- Must be done in Ruby on Rails
- Accept an address as input
- Retrieve forecast data for the given address. This should include, at minimum, the current temperature (Bonus points - Retrieve high/low and/or extended forecast)
- Display the requested forecast details to the user
- Cache the forecast details for 30 minutes for all subsequent requests by zip codes.
- Display indicator if result is pulled from cache.

Assumptions:

- This project is open to interpretation
- Functionality is a priority over form
- If you get stuck, complete as much as you can

Submission:

- Use a public source code repository (GitHub, etc) to store your code
- Send us the link to your completed code

Notes:
Please remember – it’s not just whether or not the code works that they will be focused on seeing – it’s all the rest of what goes into good Senior Software Engineering daily practices for Enterprise Production Level Code – such as specifically:

1. Unit Tests (#1 on the list of things people forget to include – so please remember, treat this
   as if it were true production level code, do not treat it just as an exercise)
2. Detailed Comments/Documentation within the code, also have a README file (Include _Decomposition_
   of the Objects in the Documentation)
3. Design Patterns (if/where applicable)
4. Scalability Considerations (if applicable)
5. Naming Conventions (name things as you would name them in enterprise-scale production code environments)
6. Encapsulation, (don’t have 1 Method doing 55 things)
7. Code Re-Use, (don’t over-engineer the solution, but don’t under-engineer it either) and any other industry Best Practices.
8. Remember to Include the UI
